# Anomaly Detection in Crowd Behavior

This project demonstrates anomaly detection in crowd behavior using multiple machine learning models. The methods explored include Decision Tree, KNN, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and DBSCAN. The notebook contains steps for data preprocessing, outlier detection, and anomaly detection.

## Introduction and Data Visualization

This section involves visualizing the dataset to understand its structure and identify any obvious patterns or anomalies.

## Data Preprocessing

In this section, data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## IQR Methods for Outliers

The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is used to detect and handle outliers in the dataset.

## Z Score Method

The Z Score method is applied to identify and remove outliers based on their Z-scores.

## Decision Tree - Z Score Method

An anomaly detection model is built using a Decision Tree, after handling outliers with the Z Score method.

## Removing Outliers Based on the Z-Score Method

This section details the process of removing outliers from the dataset based on their Z-scores.

## KNN Method

An anomaly detection model is built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Isolation Forest, LOF, and SVM

This section covers the use of Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for anomaly detection.

## Alternative Approach: Isolation Forest

An alternative approach using Isolation Forest is explored for anomaly detection.

## Alternative Approach: Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

An alternative approach using Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is explored for anomaly detection.

## DBSCAN

The Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used for anomaly detection.
