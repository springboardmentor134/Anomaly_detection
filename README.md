# Anomaly_detection
This project explores applying anomaly detection techniques to smartphone datasets in densely populated environments. By combining statistical and machine learning methods, we aim to create a model capable of effectively discerning between typical and unusual behavior patterns in smartphone usage. This versatile model can serve multiple purposes, including detecting suspicious activities, identifying potential risks, and enhancing our understanding of crowd dynamics.

# Anomalous behavior vs non-anomalous behavior
	According to any dataset, outliers represent the meaning of anomalous data which are irrelevant to the dataset. Likewise, many actions in real-time timeline series of dataset “outliers represent anomalous behavior”. For example, if a person is walking freely representing the normal behavior and same person walks slowly in crowded environment can be represented as anomalous behavior.
