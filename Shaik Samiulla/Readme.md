Project Summary: Smartphone Dataset for Anomaly Detection in Crowds

This project focuses on developing a real-time anomaly detection system using smartphone datasets in crowded environments. By combining statistical and machine learning techniques, the project aims to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior patterns in smartphone usage.

Objectives:

Real-Time Anomaly Detection:

Develop a system to monitor smartphone sensor data and alert authorities about potential anomalies.
Aid in crowd management and enhance security during large gatherings or events.
Public Safety Contribution:

Provide tools to detect potential risks in crowds, enabling proactive interventions.
Enhance overall public safety by identifying and responding to anomalies promptly.
Understanding Crowd Behavior:

Analyze smartphone data to gain insights into typical crowd behavior.
Use these insights to improve crowd management strategies and safety protocols.
Classification of Anomalies:

Identify specific types of anomalies such as falls, sudden movements, and unusual group behavior.
Tailor responses based on the classification of anomalies.
Methodology:

The project will follow a structured approach involving several key modules:

Data Ingestion:

Collecting and understanding anomaly data from relevant sources.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and formatting data, detecting and handling missing values and outliers, and visualizing data distributions.
Preliminary Statistical Models:

Using IQR (Interquartile Range) and Z-Score techniques to identify potential outliers.
Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection:

Building models using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to identify anomalies in feature space.
Validation of Anomaly Detection:

Assessing the effectiveness of the models in identifying actual anomalies.
Project Presentation & Documentation:

Preparing comprehensive documentation and a presentation to summarize the project’s goals, methodology, and results.
Implementation Plan:

The project will be implemented over eight weeks, with each week dedicated to specific milestones, ranging from data collection and preprocessing to model development, validation, and final presentation.

Evaluation:

The project’s success will be evaluated based on several criteria, including the effectiveness of data loading and preprocessing, the accuracy of anomaly detection models, and the clarity and reproducibility of the documentation and presentation.

Overall, this project aims to leverage smartphone data to enhance crowd safety by detecting anomalies in real-time, providing valuable insights into crowd dynamics, and contributing to public safety efforts through advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.
