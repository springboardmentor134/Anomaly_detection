# Anomaly Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in datasets using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. Anomaly detection is crucial in identifying unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, which can be applied in various domains such as fraud detection, network security, and fault detection in manufacturing processes.

## Features

- Preprocessing and cleaning of input data
- Implementation of various anomaly detection algorithms
- Visualization of anomalies
- Evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the models

## Algorithms Used

- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM
- Autoencoders
- LSTM-based models

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`, `keras`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anomaly-detection-project.git
    cd anomaly-detection-project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   
   Ensure your dataset is placed in the `data` directory. The dataset should be in a format readable by `pandas` (e.g., CSV).

2. **Running the Jupyter Notebook**:
   
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `anomaly_detection.ipynb`:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   
   Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the anomaly detection models, and evaluate their performance.

4. **Visualization**:
   
   The notebook includes sections for visualizing the detected anomalies using various plotting libraries.
